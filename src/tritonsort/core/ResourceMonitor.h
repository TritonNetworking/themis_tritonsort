/**
   The resource monitor provides an external interface to some of the system's
   internals. Clients can register with the resource monitor by implementing
   the interface given in ResourceMonitorClient.

   Users of the resource monitor communicate with it by opening a connection to
   the monitor's port (given by the parameter MONITOR_PORT). The monitor will
   dump a JSON object.

   When a client registers with the monitor, it does so with a particular
   key. The JSON output by the resource monitor is a collection of key/value
   pairs, where each value is an array of JSON objects, one per client that
   registered with the particular key.
