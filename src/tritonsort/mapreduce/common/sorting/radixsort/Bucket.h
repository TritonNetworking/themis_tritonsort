   Bucket is a container for key entries that supports sequential reads and
   writes. A key entry is a portion of memory that contains a fixed size key and
   an offset tag locating the key in the original buffer. Keys shorter than the
   maximum key size are padded with 0s to ensure the 'fixed size' property.

   RadixSort uses 2 sets of buckets, with 256 buckets in each set.
   Each bucket holds keys with the same byte in the key at a specified offset.
